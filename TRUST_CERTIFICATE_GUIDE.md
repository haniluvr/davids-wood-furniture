# How to Trust Your Self-Signed SSL Certificate

## üîí Make Your Browser Show the Green Lock

Currently, your site shows "Not secure" because browsers don't trust self-signed certificates by default. Follow these steps to fix it:

## Method 1: Trust Certificate in Chrome/Edge (Recommended)

### Step 1: Export the Certificate

1. Visit `https://davidswood.test:8443` in Chrome/Edge
2. Click on **"Not secure"** in the address bar
3. Click on **"Certificate is not valid"**
4. In the Certificate window, click the **"Details"** tab
5. Click **"Copy to File..."** button
6. Click **"Next"** in the Certificate Export Wizard
7. Select **"DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)"**
8. Click **"Next"**
9. Click **"Browse"** and save it as `davidswood.cer` on your Desktop
10. Click **"Next"** then **"Finish"**

### Step 2: Install the Certificate

1. **Double-click** the `davidswood.cer` file you just saved
2. Click **"Install Certificate..."**
3. Select **"Local Machine"** (requires admin rights)
4. Click **"Next"**
5. Select **"Place all certificates in the following store"**
6. Click **"Browse..."**
7. Select **"Trusted Root Certification Authorities"**
8. Click **"OK"**
9. Click **"Next"**
10. Click **"Finish"**
11. You'll see a security warning - Click **"Yes"** to install

### Step 3: Restart Your Browser

1. **Close all browser windows** completely
2. **Reopen your browser**
3. Visit `https://davidswood.test:8443`
4. **You should now see the green lock!** üéâ

## Method 2: Accept Certificate Each Time (Quick & Easy)

If you don't want to install the certificate permanently:

1. Visit `https://davidswood.test:8443`
2. Click **"Advanced"** or **"Show details"**
3. Click **"Proceed to davidswood.test (unsafe)"** or **"Continue to site"**
4. The site will load (but still show "Not secure")

**Note**: You'll need to do this each time you clear browser data or use a different browser.

## Method 3: Use Command Line (Advanced)

### For Windows Certificate Store:

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
certutil -addstore -f "ROOT" "C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.crt\davidswood\davidswood.test.crt"
```

Then restart your browser.

## Verify It's Working

After installing the certificate, you should see:

‚úÖ **Green lock icon** in the address bar  
‚úÖ **"Connection is secure"** when you click the lock  
‚úÖ URL shows `https://davidswood.test:8443`  
‚úÖ No certificate warnings  

## For Admin Subdomain

The same certificate works for:
- `https://davidswood.test:8443`
- `https://admin.davidswood.test:8443`

Both will show as secure once you trust the certificate!

## Troubleshooting

### Still showing "Not secure" after installing?

1. **Clear browser cache**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` ‚Üí Clear cached images and files
2. **Clear SSL state**: 
   - Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy and security ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Manage certificates ‚Üí Clear SSL state
3. **Restart browser completely**: Close all windows and reopen
4. **Try incognito/private mode** to test

### Certificate not found when exporting?

The certificate file is located at:
```
C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.crt\davidswood\davidswood.test.crt
```

You can install it directly from there:
1. Navigate to that folder in File Explorer
2. Double-click `davidswood.test.crt`
3. Follow installation steps above

### "This certificate has an invalid issuer"?

This is normal for self-signed certificates. That's why we need to add it to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" - this tells Windows to trust certificates issued by this certificate.

## Alternative: Use HTTP for Development

If you don't want to deal with certificate warnings, you can use:
- **HTTP**: `http://davidswood.test:8080`

Both HTTP and HTTPS versions work - HTTPS is just more secure!

## For Production

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: For a production website, use a real SSL certificate from:
- Let's Encrypt (free)
- Cloudflare (free)
- Commercial Certificate Authority (paid)

Self-signed certificates are only for local development!
